  <div class="center">
    <h1>This link is invalid.</h1>
    <p>The link you tried to access was invalid. It either was already used to reset a password or was 'corrupted'. </p>
    <p>Make sure the link does not have extra character at the end or that you got a new email with a different link. </p>
    <p>If that does not fix it you can just ask for a new password reset on the log in page.</p>
